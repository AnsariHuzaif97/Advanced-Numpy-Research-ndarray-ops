Research-based exploration and generalization of advanced NumPy functions like rollaxis, swapaxes, and many more such functions. Research like memory layout conversions (C ↔ F) for N-dimensional arrays and many more.

# Advanced NumPy: Generalized N-Dimensional Array Operations

## Domain
Scientific Computing | Data Science | Python Libraries | Research

## Description
This repository contains research-focused implementations and analysis of high-level NumPy operations such as:

- Generalizing `np.rollaxis`, `np.swapaxes`, `np.transpose` and many more for **N-dimensional arrays**
- Exploring **axis manipulation patterns**
- Memory layout conversion between **row-major (C)** and **column-major (Fortran/F)** orderings
- Performance benchmarking of different reshaping strategies
- Visual understanding and test cases for high-dimensional arrays

## Objective
To build intuition and reusable functions for manipulating N-dimensional data structures using NumPy's core logic.

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Features
- Custom utility functions that generalize built-in NumPy axis tools
- Matrix layout converters (C ↔ F)
- Interactive notebooks demonstrating:
  - Effects of axis manipulations
  - Memory layout performance impact
- Test cases and edge conditions (e.g. shape mismatches)


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
